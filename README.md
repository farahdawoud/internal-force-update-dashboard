# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple solution to ensure your mobile app users stay up-to-date with the latest version.

With this tool, you'll be able to easily manage updates to your mobile app and ensure your users always have access to the latest features and bug fixes.

Our dashboard offers two update options: force updates and flexible updates. A force update requires all users to update their app before they can continue using it, while a flexible update allows users to continue using the app without updating but provides a gentle reminder to update when they open the app.

To get started, simply log in to our dashboard, add a new version, and select the update option that best suits your needs. You'll be able to customize the update message, select the platform (IOS, ANDROID), and the environment (DEV, UAT, PROD, ..).

The deployed admin portal can be found below:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

Installs dependencies while ignoring peerDependencies when building a package tree

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
